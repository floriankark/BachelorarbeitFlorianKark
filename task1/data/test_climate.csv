there isn't a forest fire nearby, then the skies can be beautiful and pristine and
clear as can be. But if a lightning strike causes a forest fire, then all of a sudden
we are engulfed in smoke. It is proof that man's role in carbon emissions is
insignificant. As l've said before, carbon-based transportation represents about
100 years of the 4.5 billion years of our planet; a lightning strike and ensuing
wildfire emits hundreds or maybe even thousands of times the amount of carbon
of all of our cars put together.

ACTION
Who We Are...
We are a non-partisan, grassroots, youth-adult campaign with a
mission to empower schools to speak up for climate action in
order to protect current and future generations.
What We Do..
We help school boards, student councils, PTA's, and teacher's
unions to pass resolutions that do 3 things:
• Drive a paradigm shift so people recognize climate change as
a generational justice issue.
Clearly articulate the political will for all elected leaders to
support or enact common-sense climate policies (such as
national carbon pricing).
• Celebrate and expand school district responses to climate
change.

A new Indian Institute of Science
(IISC) study that uses remote
sensing data pins the eroding
forest cover as the reason why
Kerala, a state which has 44
rivers, is struggling under the
ongoing drought. Kerala has lost
906,440 hectares of forest land,
more than 50% of its total forest
area at present, between 1973
and 2016, as per the study. The
drastic reduction of forest cover,
along with high concretization,
does not bode well for the state,
said Ramkrishnan Ramabhadran,
who along with senior scientist
TV Ramachandra authored the
IISc study.

within the CO2 theory of climate. The problem-
a fact that makes the CO2 theory look astronomically
unlikely – is how planetary temperatures and CO2
levels consistently peak right when the planet starts
running out of ice to melt. You see, in each of the 5 most
recent climate tops (""interglacial periods"") we
have believable ice-core data on, temperatures
approached a couple degrees higher than today.
And obviously, a couple degrees higher, and Earth
will start to run out of ice to melt. After all, Earth is already
starting to run out of ice to melt, isn't it?

Continental margin. Sea-erosion of the continents is
something that mostly happens near the ocean's surface,
in the wave and tidal zone. Then, over the eons, and
countless climate cycles, as sea levels
cycled between ice-ages and warm-ages, wave and

tidal action eroded the continental shelf. The

remarkable abruptness of the continental break in
non-polar regions around the world speaks of a
climate bottom that as remained relatively constant for

much, the continental break would have a rounded

It should also be pointed out that most subducting
seafloor is this type of material, so just as this material
cools quickly due to all the cold seams, it also melts quite
quickly for the same reason. The seafloor not made out of
this type of material is much slower melting and thus it has
trouble subducting and tends to agglomerate to

basalt column at a time. This textbook drawing is
incidentally quite deceptive. The columns actually run from
the bottom of the lithosphere to the planet's surface at the
sea floor, and are dozens of miles tall. The basalt is
propelled upward and through the lithosphere by gas in
the magma froth. The gas bleeds off, and the +5,000°C
magma cools and then hardens as fast as a tong touched
to frozen metal, but on a geological time scale.
It must be noted that a porous cold seam exists
between the columns. Thus seawater can penetrate both
horizontally and to great depths through this porous
material. Thus each column rapidly gives off its heat to
