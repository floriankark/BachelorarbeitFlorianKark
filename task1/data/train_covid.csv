Shanghai | Thousands of Chinese tourists
planning to travel to Australia over the next
two months have been forced to cancel their
trips after Beijing slapped a ban on tour
groups overseas in an effort to control the
spread of the coronavirus.
Tour operators in China said on Monday they
had been told the ban would be in place for
as long as two months, a crippling blow for
Australia's tourism industry, which is already
reeling from months of devastating bushfires
and relies heavily on visitors from China.

Death Toll From New Coronav
An estimated 15 million have been stricken
with the flu in the U.S. so far.
The virus has killed some 8,200 in the U.S.
alone.
Youth flu deaths have more than doubled
compared to last season.
While much of the world is focused on the
coronavirus outbreak, influenza continues to
take its toll in the United States, where an
estimated 15 million people have been
infected and 8,200 have died from the disease
so far this flu season.
While the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) said those numbers aren't
unusually high, they're far higher than the
4,583 cases of coronavirus and 106 deaths

At present, there is no evidence that
companion animals / pets such as dogs or cats
can be infected with the new coronavirus.
However, it is always a good idea to wash
your hands with soap and water after contact
with pets. This protects you against various
common bacteria such as E. coli and

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness, similar to a common cold.

Interpretation The 2019-aCoV infection was of chustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities,
and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, d
characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MulBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting e
mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to esplore the applicability of the MulBSTA KOre in tat
predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-Cov infection.

>Hubei is only reporting Pneumonia cases because those are the ones they have resources to test
Entirely possible.
Someone else noticed this yesterday and I capped it just in case it came up again.
And it seemed ike it did.
They were running out of test kits earlier, so it can definitely be a case of them just saying
>Fuck it, we'l just test the ones with pneumonia, everyone else is a suspected case.
So, anons
This is fucking important, don't fucking ignore this, this might be fucking huge, alright?
These two translations are from the same translation service, so it should've made the same error on both, if it was an error.
>National report
At 04.00 on January 29, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 1737 new confirmed cases

THIS IS VERY FUCKING IMPORTANT /pol/
YOU BETTER FUCKING NOT IGNORE THIS
First of all, read the pic. That's the first part you need to be aware of.
Have you done that? Good. Now listen.
In China they have fever clinics. Now these fever clinics acts like a screening for the hospitals. If you have a fever, you don't visit the hospital first. you go to a fever clinic.
http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Blog-Health_Wellness/72154/Here-are-Shanghais-designated-fever-clinics.html
In the Hubei reports, they have included the amount of people visiting fever clinics, and the amount of people ""seen"", which I guess is a shit translation. but I would assume that is people
they could check.
>Moonrunes anon helped translate that it means ""stay""., meaning they were admitted.
>http://wjw.hubei.gov.cr/fbjd/dtyw/202001/t20200130_2016304.shtml
>On January 28. a total of 32.309 people were treated for fever clinics in the province, and 4,095 people were seen (actual translation, stay, meaning they were admitted)
But if I'm reading this correctly, this means that 32309 people came with symptoms to fever clinics in Hubei district, and 4095 people could be treated, out of these there were 1032 cases
of pneumonia.
This means that 1 in 4 people get pneumonia.
>Many of the patients I interviewed said they showed all the signs of coronavirus infection but couldn't get a confirmed diagnosis for lack of definitive testing.
>When I visited the Red Cross Hospital Wednesday, the main hall was crowded with people wearing masks as the sounds of coughing echoed through the air. Many of the patients in the
hallways had IV drips while others waited anxiously to be tested or treated.
>Several people showed me their CT scan results. which were highly suggestive of coronavirus infection, but they said they were yet to receive a confirmed diagnosis and thus couldn't be
admitted to the hospital.
>i know I am probably a mobile source of virus, but there is nothing I can do if the hospital doesn't receive me."" said a suspected coronavirus patient surnamed Li. He told me he was
unable to get the virus test because the hospital ran out of testing kits. As patients are mixed in the hospital, the risk of cross-infection is massive, he said.
>A doctor at the Red Cross Hospital said only a few public hospitals in Wuhan were equipped with testing gear for the new coronavirus and the Red Cross Hospital was not among them. The
hospital can only report suspected cases to the provincial disease control center, which will take samples for testing. It is unclear how many tests the center has done, but when I asked six
people with lung infections showing on their CT scans at the Red Cross Hospital, none of them had received a test.
>Without testing, many patients have yet to be confirmed as coronavirus infections despite highly suspicious symptoms and CT results. one hospital staffer in Wuhan told me.

I'm one of the millions in Wuhan right now who is
affected by this. It is heartbreaking to see comments
here saying how we deserve it.
Yes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they
eat everything that moves and have total disregard for
health/safety regulations. But most people aren't like
that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life.
We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as
you are, if not more.
It's CNY, and in case you're not familiar with the Chinese
culture, let me first put into perspective it's importance.
It's like thanksgiving and Christmas combined.
Historical/Traditional significance aside, for millions of
people, CNY is the only time of the year where families
get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It
is more common than not for chinese people in more
rural areas to go to cities to find better work
opportunities. They work hard for the whole year,
sending home the little money they earn to support their
children and parents. Families don't get to see each
other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is
something everyone looks forward to.
The coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year
that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are
working around the clock, many of them have not gone
home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China
are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers
have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and
protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating
masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free
accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home
are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing
free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man
have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families
because we can't leave our homes; construction workers
are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do
all these people working tireless to save lives deserve to

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness, similar to a common cold.

Pls tell ur families, relatives and friends
MOH Health Bulletin to the Public:
The Upper Respiratory Infection affecting China at present is quite serious. The virus causing it is very
potent and is resistant to existing antibiotics.
(virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics).
The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold
your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within
10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime you feel your throat is
dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to
keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train
or public transportation.
Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.
The symptoms/ description are:
1. Repeated high fever.
2. Prolonged coughing after fever.
3. Children are more prone.
4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.
This illness is highly contagious. Let's continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection.
Please share.

gender and ethnic susceptibility to 2019-nCoV
Entry of Corona-chan into lung cells is through cell surface
expression of ACE2(angiotensin converting enzyme 2), which
Corona-chan recognizes with the bling of her crown (the
projections of her eponymous Corona).
This is identical to the mechanism used by SARS-Coronavirus.
The significance of this finding can be inferred from known
expression of this enzyme on the surfaces of lung cells.
It is known that males have 30% higher expression of the enzyme
than females across all population groups. This fits with
observations that most of the deaths and infected patients are
males.
A second association that goes toward explaining the outbreak is
the association between ethnic group and enzyme expression.
A study on hypertension across three population groups (White
European, African, South Asian) found that hypertension
prevalence and ACE2 expression was proportionally linked, with
the highest of the three (South Asian) being 10% more than the
African and 35% more than the European cohorts.
The statistics here go a long way to explaining why the previous
SARS outbreak did little damage beyond Chinese borders and
shows the susceptibility of the Chinese population to zoonotic
Coronavirus infections, debunking theories that Corona-chan is a
test tube baby

write this book to alert the world of our imminent danger. I wrote this book
in 4 days. During that time I learned things I never knew, or even thought
about in my entire life. The knowledge I acquired from my Cosmic sources
shocked me. But the information contained herein is what they wanted me
to relate. I've done my best to present the information in a comprehensive
yet digestible form. Even though many of you will find this very hard to
Tomthunkit's
Theory of thhe
Universe
swallow.
We are at the intersection of critical mass and times up. Because of our
actions, the time we have left
vanishing fast due to the climate crisis
we've created. We have brought impending doom upon us; unless we unite
to take drastic measures, and make an immediate course correction. We
have run out of highway becausẻ our Creators have run out of patience.
This book is not about me. I cannot solve the problems listed in this book.
I did what I was told. It's up to you and your world leaders to do the rest. Time
is of the essence because we have been scheduled for replacement, which
is planned and ready: but we have been given one more chance for survival.
What we do with it, is up to each and every individual.

Read this book. This book lays out a compelling case for immediate action.
It debunks both theories of our origin; Creationism and Evolution. It proves
with clear, convincing, and irrefutable evidence that we were created by
Superior Beings. Our Creators are not happy. We will not be allowed to
destroy this planet (our only home and theirs) and their other creations
before they replace us.
This book contains an URGENT message about your future and the future of
our planet. Everyone SHOULD read this. It maybe the most important book
you ever read. Share it.
One World Left. One Race - Human, One mission: SAVE THE PLANET.
If you care about the people you love and your survival, read this book; then
make an informed decision. Or dismiss it at your peril. This is ngt a joke,
fiction, fantasy or written to scare you. This is yeur FINAL WARNING.

January 30, 2020
Novel Coronavirus Disease
We are closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new)
coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Thousands of
cases have been identified in China, with more than 100 fatalities. Additional cases
have been identified throughout the world, including the United States.
VA is closely tracking the occurrence of novel coronavirus in the United States and
prepared to protect the Veterans within the VA health care system and the employees
who serve them. Meanwhile, here are some important points I want to emphasize:
1. The illness is spread by respiratory droplets, similar to influenza, and symptoms
can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2-14 days
after exposure. There is much more to learn about the transmission and severity
of the coronavirus, and updates are available on the CDC webpage.
2. Our VHA Emergency Management Coordination Team is working with the Centers
for Disease Control and will stay on top of this situation as it changes. We are
working to be as prepared as possible so that each facility has a plan and training
to assess and begin the care of any Veteran or staff who arrives needing an
evaluation for potential exposure.
3. We will continually update you and the Veteran community as we receive more
information.
There is currently no vaccine to prevent an infection, although there are concentrated
efforts to develop and test solutions. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being
exposed to this virus, with everyday_preventive actions such as:
• Getting a flu shot.
• Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
(suggestion: scrub while humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song from beginning to
end twice).
• Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
• Staying home when you are sick or becoming sick.
• Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
• Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoiding all non-essential travel to China.
• If you do travel to China, call employee health before returning to work.
These basic health measures can make a huge difference in reducing the spread of
infection and can save lives.
