It must be noted that a porous cold seam exists

Wait, are you really arguing that we shouldn't
consider pesky historical facts when they get in the
way of our narrative? isn't that just actual feels over
facts irrationalism? How do you decide what's
""evident"" and what's ""mystification"" if evidence isn't
valid?
When I see Rodger, first and foremost I see a
narcissist who took refuge in any kind of fringe
belief that allowed him to maintain a certain self-
image. The ""what"" he took refuge in is just what you
have described it to be, but that doesn't mean that
you can lay his behaviour entirely or even primarily
at the feet of that ideology. I'd consider the
psychological explanation what's evident and the
political framing the mystification.

An important aspect of the FBI's assessment of Steele's election reporting
involved evaluating Steele's source network, especially whether the sub-sources
had access to reliable information. As noted in the first FISA application, Steele
relied on a primary sub-source (Primary Sub-source) for information, and this
Primary Sub-source used a network of sub-sources to gather the information that
was relayed to Steele; Steele himself was not the originating source of any of the
factual information in his reporting.334 The FBI employed multiple methods in an
effort to ascertain the identities of the sub-sources within the network, including
meeting with Steele in October 2016 (prior to him being closed for cause) and
conducting various investigative inquiries. For example, the FBI determined it was
plausible that at least some of the sub-sources had access to intelligence pertinent
to events described in Steele's election reporting. Additionally, the FBI's evaluation
of Steele's sub-sources generated some corroboration for the election reporting
(primarily routine facts about dates, locations, and occupational positions that was
mostly public source information). Further, by January 2017 the FBI was able to
identify and arrange a meeting with the Primary Sub-source. 335
The FBI conducted interviews of the Primary Sub-source in January, March,
and May 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele
election reporting. In particular, the FBI's interview with Steele's Primary Sub-
source in January 2017, shortly after the FBI filed the Carter Page FISA Renewal

A new Indian Institute of Science
(IISC) study that uses remote
sensing data pins the eroding
forest cover as the reason why
Kerala, a state which has 44
rivers, is struggling under the
ongoing drought. Kerala has lost
906,440 hectares of forest land,
more than 50% of its total forest
area at present, between 1973
and 2016, as per the study. The
drastic reduction of forest cover,
along with high concretization,
does not bode well for the state,
said Ramkrishnan Ramabhadran,
who along with senior scientist
TV Ramachandra authored the
IISc study.

recent climate tops (""interglacial periods"") we
have believable ice-core data on, temperatures
approached a couple degrees higher than today.

write this book to alert the world of our imminent danger. I wrote this book
in 4 days. During that time I learned things I never knew, or even thought
about in my entire life. The knowledge I acquired from my Cosmic sources
shocked me. But the information contained herein is what they wanted me
to relate. I've done my best to present the information in a comprehensive
yet digestible form. Even though many of you will find this very hard to

We are at the intersection of critical mass and times up. Because of our
actions, the time we have left
vanishing fast due to the climate crisis
we've created. We have brought impending doom upon us; unless we unite
to take drastic measures, and make an immediate course correction. We
have run out of highway becausẻ our Creators have run out of patience.
This book is not about me. I cannot solve the problems listed in this book.
I did what I was told. It's up to you and your world leaders to do the rest. Time
is of the essence because we have been scheduled for replacement, which
is planned and ready: but we have been given one more chance for survival.
What we do with it, is up to each and every individual.
The Greatest Siery Ever Told
Read this book. This book lays out a compelling case for immediate action.
It debunks both theories of our origin; Creationism and Evolution. It proves
with clear, convincing, and irrefutable evidence that we were created by
Superior Beings. Our Creators are not happy. We will not be allowed to
destroy this planet (our only home and theirs) and their other creations
before they replace us.
This book contains an URGENT message about your future and the future of
our planet. Everyone SHOULD read this. It maybe the most important book
you ever read. Share it.

If you care about the people you love and your survival, read this book; then

Who We Are...
We are a non-partisan, grassroots, youth-adult campaign with a
mission to empower schools to speak up for climate action in
order to protect current and future generations.
What We Do..
We help school boards, student councils, PTA's, and teacher's
unions to pass resolutions that do 3 things:
• Drive a paradigm shift so people recognize climate change as
a generational justice issue.
Clearly articulate the political will for all elected leaders to
support or enact common-sense climate policies (such as
national carbon pricing).
• Celebrate and expand school district responses to climate
change.

Novel Coronavirus
Frequently Asked Questions
Q) How does the virus spread ?
Ans- The specific modes of transmission of the virus is not clear yet since
it is a novel virus. This virus probably originally emerged from an
animal source but now seems to be spreading from
person-to-person. It's not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads
from person-to-person. It is thought to have happened mainly when
an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and
other respiratory pathogens spread.
Q) What is Gol doing about 2019-nCoV?
Ans- A 24*7 helpline has been setup by the Gol at NCDC, New Delhi to
answer all queries regarding the disease. The Gol is closely
monitoring the situation and has ascertained the level of
preparedness in every State of India. As this is an emerging, rapidly
evolving situation the Gol will continue to provide updated
information as it becomes available.
Q) Is there a vaccine to get protection from 2019 novel Corona Virus ?
Ans- Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against
2019- novel Corona Virus.
