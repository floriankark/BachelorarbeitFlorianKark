ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
NOVEL CORONAVIRUS ( NCOV) - The name for this
kind of virus comes from the crownlike spikes it has
on its surface– ""corona"" is Latin for ""crown.""
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect
mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. In rare cases,
they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they
can be transmitted from animals to humans,
according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild
to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a
common cold.

of Science and Technology.
The main research directions of the research group:
Taking bats as the research object, I will answer the molecular mechanism that can coexist with Ebola and SARS- associated corona
virus for a long time without causing disease, and its relationship with flight and longevity. Virology, immunology, cell biology, and
multiple omics are used to compare the differences between humans and other mammals.
Why is this notable? Because as it turns out, this is a job posting for the lab of Dr. Peng Zhou (S), Ph.D., a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology
and Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group. Some more on Zhou's background from the Institute (google translated):
He received his PhD in Wuhan Virus Research Institute in 2010 and has worked on bat virus and immunology in Australia and
Singapore, In 2009 , he took the lead in starting the research on the immune mechanism of bat long-term carrying and
transmittng virus in the world. So far, he has published more than 30 SCI articles, including the first and corresponding author's
Nature , Cell Host Microbe and PNAS. At present, research on bat virus and immunology is continuing, and it has received support
from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of
Science and Technology.
Below is a list of several recent papers published by Dr. Zhou
• Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats
• Fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin
• IFNAR2-dependent gene expression profile induced by IFN-a in Pteropus alecto bat cells and impact of IFNAR2 knockout on virus infection
• Immunogenicity of the spike glycoprotein of Bat SARS-like coronavirus
• Bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus ORF36 homologues display different interferon antagonist activities

Press Release / 30 January 2020
The Department of Health (DOH) today confirmed that a 38-year-old female Chinese patient
under investigation (PUI) is positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after her laboratory
results arrived today from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne,
Australia. DOH, however, continues to guarantee the public that all necessary precautionary
measures are being taken to halt the spread of the virus.
The confirmed case arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January
21, 2020. The patient sought consult and was admitted in one of the country's government
hospitals last January 25 after experiencing mild cough. She is currently asymptomatic.
""I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were
able to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close
coórdination with World Health Organization and other national agencies, and the utilization of
DOH's decision tool. We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted and
have activated the Incident Command System of the said hospital for appropriate management,
specifically on infection control, case management, and containment. We are also implementing
measures to protect the health staff providing care to these patients,"" Health Secretary Francisco
T. Duque III said.
DOH is also in close coordination with the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious
Diseases (EID) which includes representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA),
Interior and Local Government (DILG), Justice (DOJ), Labor and Employment (DOLE),
Tourism (DOT), Transportation (DOTT), and Information and Communications Technology
(DICT). The Task Force will convene a high-level meeting tomorrow, January 31, 2020, to
discuss the first confirmed case and developments arising from this health event.
The Bureau of Quarantine remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities
from all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance. DOH assured that its health facilities are
equipped and prepared to receive and care for PUIS and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness, similar to a common cold.
