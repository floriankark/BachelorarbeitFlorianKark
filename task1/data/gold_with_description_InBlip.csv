Eric S. Yuan
CEO and Chairman
Zoom Video Communications, Inc.
55 Almaden Boulevard, 6th Floor
San Jose, CA 95113
Dear Mr. Yuan,
I write with concern and to seek information regarding how Zoom handles the personal
data of its users and protects against security threats and abuse against its services. The millions
of Americans now unexpectedly attending school, celebrating birthdays, seeking medical help,
and sharing evening drinks with friends over Zoom during the Coronavirus pandemic should not
have to add privacy and cybersecurity fears to their ever-growing list of worries.
Zoom is increasingly being used by schools and healthcare providers that have shut down
or limited their operations to stop the spread of Coronavirus, raising questions about how its
services comply with federal and state privacy laws protecting students, patients, and consumers.
While Zoom has recently taken commendable steps to clarify how it handles this information, its
privacy policy still grants it broad discretion to use personal data for other purposes than
providing video conferences. For example, Zoom states that it ""does use certain standard
advertising tools on our marketing sites which, provided you have allowed it in your cookie
preferences, sends personal data to the tool providers, such as Google."" Parents, patients, and
families should not have to worry that their children's information, their health condition, or their
private discussions are being used for advertising and other unintended purposes.
Zoom has a troubling history of software design practices and security lapses that have
posed significant risks to the privacy and safety of its users. Until last week, Zoom's iOS apps
routinely sent personal data about its users to Facebook, whether or not they had a Facebook
account, in order to track their behavior and target advertising. Zoom has also previously failed
to respond in a timely and diligent manner to security vulnerabilities in its Mac client that
allowed malicious attackers to silently eavesdrop on Zoom users, crash their computers, and

The Honorable Rodney Frelinghuysen
Chairman
House Committee on Appropriations
H-305, The Capitol
Washington, DC 20515
Dear Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey,
As appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2019 are considered, we urge that the Committee
oppose harmful provisions or policy riders that undermine efforts to reduce the impacts of climate
change.
Climate change is already a threat to life and property, rising temperatures, sea levels, and
worsening impacts from severe weather events. The bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus, of
which we are all members, is engaged in developing market-based solutions to address the critical
issue of climate change.
May 18, 2018
The Honorable Nita M. Lowey
Ranking Member
House Committee on Appropriations
1016 Longworth House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515
Appropriations provisions and policy riders that prohibit or limit the use of funds to study
initiatives to reduce climate change impacts, and prohibit or limit the use of funds to make our
infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change will make our country more prone to
the damaging effects of climate change. We agree that provisions in the appropriations bills must
advance our fight against climate change, not undermine progress.
Given the critical importance of reducing the harmful impacts of climate change, the
Committee should oppose and remove any policy provisions or riders from the Fiscal Year 2019
appropriations bills that undermine efforts to confront climate change. We appreciate your
attention to this matter and look forward continuing to work with the Committee in the future.
Sincerely,
Luftbef

1222540149793460233,https://twitter.com/user/status/1222540149793460233,Update on corona virus Please read #coronavirus https://t.co/6NBFc5xx0A,"Received from friends in HK. Don't know if it's true or
not but after reading it, it make sense coz it's part of
personal hygiene.
""Hi folks,
This is from a doctor in Hong Kong who consulted
with his friend (who currently works on SARS
prevention research) on some effective ways to
prevent the Coronavirus. It was originally written in
Cantonese style Chinese so l used my best attempt
to translate it into English for you guys. Worth a read.
About the virus:
1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm
diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95
feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when
someone who's infected sneezes in front of you, it
will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it
drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live
for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in
contact with any metal surface, wash your hands
with soap thoroughly.
3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12
hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the
virus. But if you are really worried, you can add some
non-chlorine bleach or oxygen bleach. For winter
clothing that does not require daily washing, you can
put it out under the sun to kill the virus.
About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by
Coronavirus:
1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have
the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4
days
2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and
drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing
pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days.
3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in
breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the
normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in
water. It's important to go seek immediate medical
attention if you feel like this.
About prevention:
1. The most common way of getting infected is by
touching things in public, so you must wash your
hands frequently. The virus can only live on your
hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those
5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose
unwittingly lol).
2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you
can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to
eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in
your throat (before dripping down to your lungs).
Some of you may not agree with this, but at least you
have read it and know some key info about the virus.
Hope this helps!""

virus to be the tormenting
trickster with a bagful of
nasty surprises. We are just
getting used to a well-
spring of evidence that regularly chal-
lenges and shatters early assumptions.
We have seen how this 'respiratory
virus' reveals whole-body pathology,
spreads by aerosols besides droplets,
affects children besides adults, trou-
bles through chronic sequelae even
after apparent recovery from an acute
infection (long Covid) and continues
to give positive viral test results

The latest surprise to be delivered
by this virus is a reported case of rein-
fection'in Hong Kong. A 33-year-old
man had a diagnosed Covid-19 infec-
tion four-and-half months ago, with
symptoms and a positive test, and
recovered uneventfully. After his
recent return to Hong Kong from for-
eign travel, he was tested at the airport
as part of the surveillance protocol
there. The nasal swab tested positive
for the Covid-19 virus. The genetic sig-
nature of this virus was different from
the earlier one, meaning that he had
acquired it from a different person
than during the initial infection.
This time around the person was
asymptomatic and remained so. The
consternation that greeted this
report was because of the concern
that acquired immunity appeared to
be short-lived and not protective
against reinfection.Does it mean that
this virus can cause repeated infec-
tion as it recycles through different
human beings at different times?
Questions were raised about the value
of a vaccine if the immunity con-
ferred is so short-lived.
Questions about reinfection were
raised even earlier when reports had
come in a few months ago from South
Korea, China and Europe that some
people who had tested positive for the
virus in an RT-PCR test, and had clin-
ically recovered, tested positive again
in that test a few weeks later. Some of
them had tested negative infection in
between. Most had antibodies pre-
sent as evidence of the immune
defence. Whether the repeated test
positivity was due to 'reinfection',
'reactivation' or a 'false-positive test
result' was debated. After detailed
evaluation and scrutiny of case
records, South Korean scientists

The case in Hong Kong is different.

Why does this happen, if immunity
is supposed to last long? We need to
understand the intricacies of the
immune response to unravel this.
Apart from innate immunity, which is
the body's initial non-specific
response to a microbial invader, spe-
cific adaptive immunity is acquired by
the body in response to the infective
virus or a vaccine. This tailored
response provides the second stage of
the body's immune response to the
virus when it enters the body. The
entry of the virus into the nose or
mouth may not be thwarted by the
virus, but the subsequent damage is
prevented. To put it simply, the initial

subsequent'disease'is.
high levels of anti-viral antibodies, but
nasal swabs still tested positive for the
Covid-19 virus. This raised questions
on the efficacy of the vaccine, but
Oxford's researchers countered by say-
ing that the strong immune response
would still prevent the disease.
When the virus enters the body, the
immune response that is most evi-
dent and often studied is the systemic
response of circulating antibodies and
cellular immunity. The antibody-
mediated immunity
consists of immunoglob-
ulins IgM and IgG,
secreted by bone mar-
row-derived B lympho-
cytes. The former is
short-lived, beginning to
rise early in the second
week of the infection and
fading in the fourth
week. The latter is
detectable late in thesec-
ond, peaks by four weeks
and then declines to fade
away by three months.
Cellular immunity is provided by T
lymphocytes, which are originally
derived from the thymus gland. Lym-
phoid tissues, which are widely dis-
tributed in the body, produce both
types of immunity, to provide the
body's defence against unwelcome
microbial invaders.

Transforming societies and transforming tourism: sustainable
tourism in times of change
It is a year since we marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Journal of Sustainable Tourism, noting
then that as we ""embark upon the next quadranscentennial... we recognise that the 25 years ahead
present a new order of challenges confronting sustainable development and sustainable tourism"".
Specifically, we acknowledged the urgency of the challenges we collectively face, that include pov-
erty and inequality, food and water security, human health and well-being, socio-cultural change,
clean energy, biodiversity, resource depletion and climate change, and the need for tourism scholars
not only to produce world-class research, but also to ensure to the greatest extent possible that their
research is disseminated across sectors of the economy, levels of government, and communities of
policy and practice. As we embark on the next 25 years, it is evident that we are now urgently con-
fronting the transformation of our societies and, inevitably, the transformation of tourism.
The urgency of the transformation is perhaps most vividly expressed by the concept of planetary
boundaries (Figure 1). This framework recognizes that within the limits of the planetary boundaries,
humanity can continue to develop and flourish, but transgressing the boundaries risks irreversible
global environmental change (see G√∂ssling & Hall, 2006). While the concept of planetary boundaries
continues to be advanced through transdisciplinary research into socio-ecological systems (Stock-
holm Resilience Centre, 2017), it is cautionary to note that three of the nine boundaries (""novel enti-
ties"", ""functional diversity"" and ""atmospheric aerosol loading"") are yet to be accurately quantified,
two (""climate change"" and ""land-system change"") are in the ""zone of uncertainty (increasing risk)"",
and two (""genetic diversity"" and ""biogeochemical flows"") are already ""beyond the zone of uncertainty
(high risk)"". The transformation of our societies will be the litmus test for sustainable development.
over the course of the next 25 years. This is the challenge confronting a new generation of tourism
scholars.
The extent of human influence on the biosphere is such that some now argue that Earth has
entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene (Flannery, 2005; Ruddiman, 2005). The Anthropo-
cene is generally considered to date to the 1950s, through the development of rapid industrialization
and the proliferation of nuclear activity, which have shaped global systems in ways that are geologi-
cally long-lasting and in some cases irreversible (Fulton, 2017). The period from the mid-twentieth
century is referred to as the ""Great Acceleration"", during which global change in the form of popula-
tion growth, urbanization and consumer demand accelerated at an unprecedented rate (Ho, 2012).
The diverse manifestations of the Anthropocene, according to Carrington (2016), include among
other things:
- Accelerated plant and animal extinction rates;
- Concentrations of climate-warming carbon dioxide increasing in the atmosphere at the fastest.
rate in 66 million years;
- Concentrations of plastics that in future will be identifiable in fossil records;
Levels of nitrogen and phosphorous in soils due to fertilizer use that are likely to have the
largest impact on the nitrogen cycle in 2.5 billion years;
- Permanent particulate sediment on glacial ice as black carbon from the burning of fossil fuels.
Such drivers of environmental change draw the temporal dimension of popular approaches to
sustainability into deep question (Spector, Higham, & Doering, 2017). The framing of sustainability

Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship
Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to measure and improve how antibiotics are prescribed by clinicians and used by
patients. Improving antibiotic prescribing and use is critical to effectively treat infections, protect patients from harms
caused by unnecessary antibiotic use, and combat antibiotic resistance.
CDC's Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship offer providers and facilities a set of key principles to guide efforts to improve
antibiotic use and, therefore, advance patient safety and improve outcomes. These frameworks complement existing
guidelines and standards from key healthcare partner organizations, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America,
Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, American Society of Health System Pharmacists, Society of Infectious
Diseases Pharmacists, and The Joint Commission.
CDC recognizes that there is no ""one size fits all"" approach to optimize antibiotic use for all settings. The complexity of
medical decision-making surrounding antibiotic use and the variability in facility size and types of care in U.S. healthcare
settings require flexible programs and activities.",images_labeled/test/1432736989292400640.jpg,http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E-IabdJWEAMfs1s.jpg,Yes,"The image features a computer screen displaying a webpage for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.

Additionally, there are links to other relevant pages within the CDC website for further information and resources."

The Australian Government is committed to keeping Australia secure
against potential threats. The Government continues to fund initiatives
such as the National Medical Stockpile, the World Health Organization
Collaborating Centre for Influenza Research and Reference, and contracts
for supply of pandemic vaccine to protect Australians.
However, it is inevitable that the world will face another influenza
pandemic. While there is no certainty about where or when the next one
will occur, Australia must be prepared. An influenza pandemic represents
a significant risk to Australia. It has the potential to cause high levels of
disease and death and disrupt our community socially and economically.
This plan-the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza
(AHMPPI)-outlines Australia's strategy to manage an influenza pandemic
and minimise its impact on the health of Australians and our health system.
The new and improved AHMPPI takes a significantly different approach
to the previous plan and outlines the measures that the health sector as a whole would consider taking in
response to an influenza pandemic. Continuous and extensive consultation with states and territories and other
relevant stakeholders has enabled feedback to shape the development of the document.",images_labeled/test/1247288495250366464.jpg,http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EU9B-aCUEAMPf9c.jpg,No,"The image depicts a man wearing a suit and tie, standing in front of a green background.

Vitamin D and COVID-19 in older age:
evidence versus expectations
The current global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus infection originated in Wuhan,
China, during December 2019; over 50 million
cases have been diagnosed to date. Older
age and comorbidity have proven to be key
markers of risk for severity of COVID-19 and
mortality,¬π2 and residents of care homes have
been proven to be at high risk. The Office
for National Statistics has recorded 16 111
deaths related to COVID-19 in care home
residents in England up to 20 November
2020.¬≥ In the first wave of the pandemic, 46%
of all excess deaths in England and Wales
up to 7 August occurred in care homes.4
Older age is associated with increasing
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which can
affect up to 40% of care home residents.5
There is considerable overlap between the
non-modifiable risk factors for severe SARS-
CoV-2 infection and those associated with
deficiency of vitamin D. For example, age,
ethnicity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary
and cardiac diseases; in addition, there is
the observed trend towards greater severity
of disease in northern latitudes. While
these could imply an association between
reduced vitamin D levels and susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection this may simply be an
ecological fallacy. Therefore, it is important to
understand the strength of evidence provided
by epidemiological and observational studies
of COVID-19, and compare it with what is
known from clinical trials of the impact
of vitamin D supplementation on acute
respiratory infections, including those due to
SARS-CoV-2.
""Early ... pilot evidence suggests a short-term
protective effect of prior vitamin D bolus dosing in
French older adults living in care homes, resulting in
reduced mortality over a mean 36 days of follow-up.""
conflated with impressions that vitamin D
has a direct impact on the course of COVID-
19. Recent confused statements by the
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
regarding the status of trials of vitamin D
for prevention of COVID-19 have not helped;
however, up-to-date rapid evidence reviews
I have concluded that there is no robust
evidence base in older adults to recommend
vitamin D supplementation for the prevention
or treatment of COVID-19.8
EVIDENCE-EPIDEMIOLOGY AND
INTERVENTIONS
Reduced vitamin D levels are associated with
increased risks of respiratory tract infections.
Geographical, ethnic, and age variations
in COVID-19 infections and severity have
prompted further research into the potential
role of vitamin D; a negative correlation
has been observed between estimated
national mean vitamin D levels and SARS-
CoV-2 infections and deaths in 20 European
countries.10 Further observational studies,
taking account of ethnicity, have linked viral
respiratory infection and severity of COVID-
19 with deficiency of vitamin D.11.12 A newly
have been identified that might account for any
association between deficiency of vitamin D
and increased risks from SARS-CoV-2, and
some evidence exists for beneficial effects
with other coronavirus infections. Vitamin D
deficiency has been linked to immune-
dysregulation;¬π it plays a role in regulating both
innate and adaptive immunity, and immune
cell proliferation.1¬π4 Although recently updated
meta-analytic evidence continues to suggest
a modest protective effect against acute
respiratory infections for a daily vitamin D
dose equivalent of 400-1000 international
units (IU) (odds ratio 0.70; 95% confidence
interval = 0.55 to 0.89),13 there are to the
authors' knowledge, to date, no published
adequately powered trial results examining
the impact of vitamin D supplementation on
COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality as
a primary outcome. Early quasi-experimental
pilot evidence suggests a short-term
protective effect of prior vitamin D bolus
dosing in French older adults living in care
homes, resulting in reduced mortality over
a mean 36 days of follow-up.15 Many further
studies are in progress, and large trials

influenced both by fictional narratives (literary science fiction,

DATA NEVER SLEEPS 8.0
How much data is generated every minute?
In 2020, the world changed fundamentally-and so did the data that makes the world go round. As COVID-19 swept the
globe, nearly every aspect of life-from work to working out-moved online, and people depended more and more on
apps and the Internet to socialize, educate and entertain ourselves. Before quarantine, just 15% of Americans worked
from home. Now over half do. And that's not the only big shift. In our 8th edition of Data Never Sleeps, we bring you the
latest stats on how much data is being created in every digital minute-a trend that shows no sign of stopping.

Please stop saying you ""researched it.""
You didn't research anything and its highly probable that you
dont even know how to do so.
Did you compile a literature review and write abstracts on each
article? Or better yet, did you collect a random sample of
sources and perform independent probability statistics on the
reported results? No?
Did you at least take each article, one by one and look into the
source ( that would be the author, publisher and funder), then
critique the writing for logical fallacies, cognitive distortions
and plain inaccuracies.
Did you ask yourself why this source might publish these
particular results? Did you follow the trail of references and
apply the same source of scrutiny to them?
No? Then you didnt fucking research anything. You read or
watched a video, most likely with little to no objectivity. You
came across something in your algorithm manipulated feed,
something that jived with your implicit biases and served your
confirmation bias, and subconsciously applied your emotional
filters and called it proof.
Scary.

IBM has carried out research on digital transformation for better understanding
SMEs' data storage needs to stay ahead of the competition.
Over half of SMEs - 53% - are using
cloud only storage solutions.
8% are using Public Cloud, 22% are using
Private Cloud, and 23% are using Multi Cloud.
44% of SMEs believe that they are not yet able to monetise their data. Of these:
35% say the reason is because their
data doesn't provide enough insight.
15% say becuse their
data is too disparate.
40%
7%
are using a mixture of onsite and cloud. are using onsite only.
21% say because the data is not
able to be fully trained and tested.
