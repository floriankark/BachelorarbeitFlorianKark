2018 SPPA Alumni Reception
Dear SPPA alumni,
Every year the School of Public Policy and Administration (SPPA) welcomes new students into our programs. This
year, we are organizing an alumni reception for the close of the first week of school to help integrate these new
students into our Ottawa community.
We invite you to join us! SPPA alumni, please come out to welcome our new students and re-connect with fellow
graduates.
The reception will take place from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm on Friday, September 7 in the Atrium of Richcraft Hall on
Carleton University Campus. Matt Jones - Assistant Deputy Minister, Pan-Canadian Framework Implementation
Office, Environment and Climate Change Canada and MAPA graduate 2001 - will offer brief remarks to the
incoming students, giving them advice on how to best use their two years at Carleton.
The reception will follow an Induction Exercise held from 1:30 pm to 4:45 pm that will focus on Canada's Opioid
Crisis. Alumni are welcome to attend this event also.
For more details and to register for the exercise and reception, please visit https://carleton.ca/sppa/cu-

मुंबई : केरळच्या महापुराचा थेट संबंध
कार्बनच्या उत्सर्जनाशी आहे, रोज
पृथ्वीवर धावणार्या सुमारे २०० कोटी
मोटारींशी आहे. मात्र, आलिशान
मोटारींच्या, गगनचुंबी इमारतींच्या
जाहिरातींमुळे दुर्घटनांच्या मुळाशी
जाणारी खरी कारणे जनतेपर्यंत
पोहोचतच नाहीत, असे
पर्यावरणतज्ज्ञ गिरीश राऊत यांनी
व्यक्त केले. केरळ येथील महापुराची
कारणे जाणून घेण्यासाठी 'लोकमत'ने
पर्यावरणतज्ज्ञ गिरीश राऊत यांच्याशी
संवाद साधला. या वेळी त्यांनी
महापुरांचा
उत्सर्जनाशी असल्याचे सांगितले.
गिरीश
पश्चिम घाटातील हस्तक्षेपामुळे भारतीय
उपमहाद्वीपावरील पर्जन्यमानावर परिणाम होत आहे,
असा अहवाल २०१० मध्ये गाडगीळ समितीने दिला.
मात्र, याकडे दुर्लक्ष केले जात आहे. केंद्र, राज्याने
उपाययोजना केल्या, तरच वातावरण बदल आणि
अनपेक्षित पावसापासून धोका टाळता येईल.
उत्तर प्रदेश, बिहारमध्ये दरवर्षी महापुराचे तांडव सुरु
असते, त्यावर उपाय शोधता आला नाही. थोडसा
पाऊस झाला, तरी मुंबई तुंबते. चेन्नई, बंगळुरुसारख्या येथील काही भागाला
महानगरांत पूरस्थिती निर्माण होते.
केरळमध्ये फटका बसला, तो पर्यावरणदृष्ट्या
अतिसंवेदनशील क्षेत्राला. नियम धाब्यावर बसवून
केलेले बांधकाम, चेकडॅम, यामुळे भूस्खलन झाले. येथे
अतिक्रमण झाले नसते, तर आपत्ती ओढावली नसती.
पश्चिम घाट
जैवविविधता तज्ज्ञ
समितीने अहवालात
दगडखाणींवर बंधने
घालण्यात यावी, अशी जाते. मुंबईतील २६ जुलैच्या

भागांत ५0 ते १00 वर्षांपूर्वी
सुरुवात झाली, पण पाऊस
तर कोट्यवधी वर्षांपासून
पड़त आहे. त्यामुळे केरळ,
मुंबई किंवा जगात महापुराने
उडालेला हाहाकार हा केवळ
पावसामुळे नाही, तर सध्या
पृथ्वीच्या तापमानात होत
असलेल्या महाविस्फोटक
वाढीशी त्याचा संबंध आहे.

राऊत
यांच्या
म्हणण्यानुसार, खनिज तेलावर प्रक्रिया
करताना मोठ्या प्रमाणात कार्बनचे केरळ
उत्सर्जन होत असते. या तेलावर वाहने
चालतात. जगात दरवर्षी उत्सर्जित वाढतच राहणार आहे. तापमानवाढ जाणार आहे.
होणार्या १ हजार कोटी टन कार्बन डाय अपरिवर्तनीय झाली आहे. फक्त काही

Darfur, monsoons and flooding in Bangladesh and the

their homes. As our world heats up and sea levels rise, the
problem of forced migration around the world is projected
to become far worse.
And in refusing to take climate change or responsibility for
our planet seriously, the Trump administration is
encouraging the conditions that will increase unauthorized
migrations to the United States and elsewhere.

18) Now again, when new volcanic air comes up, it tends
to come up as a froth of super-high pressure gas and
super-hot magma from deep within the planet. The high
pressure gas accounts for how the froth rises, and how it
forces its way out through the lithosphere.

As this super-hot magma cools, it gives off heat
warming Earth's oceans and surface. But in cooling, it also
accretes as rock the sea floor rift/ridge – like a tongue
touched to frozen metal, but on geological time scale. So
while the bubbles of CO2-rich new volcanic air replenish
the atmosphere and bring up magma that warms the
surface, they also drive sea-floor spreading. Then this
seafloor spreading drives earthquakes, plate margin
volcanos, and continental drift. Thus these 'soda bottle'
gas bubbles are Gaia's primary driving force, directly or
indirectly giving rise to all active geology, as well as
atmosphere and climate. Here is why the full version of
this theory is also named ""The Unified Gaia Theory""
Note the abrupt edge at the continental break. The
average width of the continental shelf is 60km and the fall
is 135m, thus it has a remarkably shallow 0.225%-slope
on average.

Calving Indicates TOO MUCH ICE!
Redford: Time to step up game on climate change - CNN.com
We know what's driving the problem of climate change, and we know what to do
about it, writes Robert Redford.
Climate morons believe that glaciers calving are an indication of ""climate change""
Glaciers are rivers of ice that flow towards the sea. Snow falls in the interior, and
eventually finds its way to the ocean via gravity. All of the snow that falls, has to return to
the sea. In the case of Greenland, that is 500 billion tons of ice per year.
Their logic is as intelligent as saying all the water flowing out the mouth of the Mississippi
is an indication of drought. Complete imbeciles.

Notice of Public Lecture
Heritage in the Age of Climate Change
The movement to preserve our built heritage has changed
dramatically over the last 50 years. Environmental issues have become
a major consideration. ""Cities, and the buildings which comprise them,
account for more than 75% of the world's greenhouse gasses. That's the
bad news. The good news is that building super-efficient new buildings
doesn't help fix the problem: rehabilitating and repurposing old
buildings does. As Carl Elephante, president of the American Institute of
Architects says, 'the greenest building is one that's already built."" Erik
Hanson, Heritage Resources Coordinator for the City of Peterborough,
will explain why heritage is the emerging champion in the race to zero
net carbon and discuss what municipalities and the private sector can do
to support the sustainable rehabilitation of existing buildings.

Just so we are clear, ""Climate Change""
measures changes over time in the statistics
of the weather (as well as state of the
oceans, ice, etc.). Those statistics include
averages but also extremes. So trends in
record heat, drought, floods, etc. are
measures of climate change too.

""Her re-posts frequently proclaim that global warming is a myth, that vaccines are a form of population control, &amp; that the LGBTQ+ movement wants to normalize pedophilia.""

Great statement from @katieomatheson

https://t.co/kTJ02MYrqE https://t.co/WdW6IDYzX5","Lisa Cummins seems to have the
inability to distinguish fact from
conspiracy theory. Media literacy is
an incredibly important part of
education in this day and age, and
to see a member of the state school
board pass around half-truths or
all-out fantasies on social media
should be alarming to any Utahn
who cares about quality education.
While we encourage diversity of
opinion and thought, the personal
posts that Lisa Cummins shares on
her social media call into question
the appropriateness of her serving
in a supervisory role over the
education of our children. Of
particular concern is her spreading
conspiracy theories that vaccines
may be unsafe. Vaccinations are
critical to the health and safety of
students-- especially those who are
medically unable to receive them.
By spreading false narratives about
the safety of vaccines, she is putting
the health and education of Utah
students at risk.

Dr. Long suggests that NCDC's adjustments eradicated the difference between RURAL
and URBAN environments, thus hiding urban heating. The consequence:

NCDC “...has taken liberty to alter the actual rural measured values"".

Mr Turnbull also noted the pressure placed by his father's government on AGL to keep its ailing
Liddell power station going beyond its scheduled 2022 closure date.
""This is the behaviour that exists in emerging markets, where the cost of capital is much higher,""
he said. ""How can you expect people to make long-term investment decisions when clowns trying
to game the news cycle are a key driver of investment returns?""
He said efforts to keep ageing coal-fired power stations going, noting that Western Australia's bid
to stop the Muja plant going - at the cost of $300 million – ""was a terrible failure"".
""Such spending is like trying to keep crappy cars – like a 1994 Ford Laser – on the road.""
Worse, the operators of such plants as Liddell and Gladstone ran the risk of a ""horrific
industrial accident"" that could literally cook unfortunate employees like a Chinese dumpling.

Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming https://t.co/cVlR0Rb3Yr #bcwildfire https://t.co/dAx59bKpix","The answer lies in the summer's record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts.
Days of near-10o-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West
in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in
early August.
""This will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of
temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this
winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote
really large fires,"" says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-
Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.
In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were
enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms.
""The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect
recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for
fire in these systems),"" said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the
University of Idaho, in an email. “I was running a few numbers this morning,
and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to
Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for
the longest number of days without measurable rain.""
This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For
more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity,
which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree
of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming,
Williams said.
""Now, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate
change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3
degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And
there's a heat wave on top of that,"" said Williams. ""Because of the exponential
influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse
influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.""

That would be with the BC Liberals. Over 10
years between 2006 and 2015 they spent
only $8 million a year to remove fuels from
just 80,000 of a total 685,000 hectares of
high-risk forest land that urgently needs
action. And another one million hectares
also require treatment to prevent fires.
At the same time, it cost the B.C.
government an average $182 million every
year to fight forest fires – more than $1.8
billion in total.
And this summer so far the province has
spent $100 million to pay some of the
unexpected expenses of thousands of
evacuated residents and $204 million to
fight the fires.
It's the epitome of the old saying: “Penny

crops with their wild ancestors, they propagate superhardy

As erratic weather patterns intensify, farmers need crops that

owned renewable schemes only existing in the UK on a very small
scale. But in Germany, over 50% of renewable-energy capacity is
community-owned. And online crowdfunding or peer-to-peer (P2P)
lending, allowing individuals to lend or raise money for projects
directly, could be set to kick-start community-ownership of renewable
energy in the UK too.

Did Isaac Newton Need Peer Review?
Peer review is cargo cult science. Exhaustive attempts to prove it raises
research quality have come up empty. On the other hand, its
shortcomings (inconsistency, superficiality, subjectivity, inability to
detect fraud, tribalism) are legion. If a series of pre-publication steps are
followed, goes this cargo cult thinking, sound science is the end result.
Academia has mythologized peer review. In that universe, it isn't a
mundane editorial tool, but a sacred process by which unpublished
research gets elevated and anointed and transformed into 'real' work
you can point to when applying for grants and promotions.
One of the dirty little secrets of this mythology is that journals have
always been at liberty to define peer review however they please.
External oversight, enforcement, and minimum standards have never
been part of the picture.

TRUTH TO POWER
That flooding is mostly a combination of (1) natural sea level rise (I show there has been no
acceleration of sea level rise beyond what was already happening since the 1800s), and (2) satellite-
measured sinking of the reclaimed swamps that have been built upon for over 100 years in Miami
Beach.
In other words, Miami Beach was going to have to deal with the increasing flooding from their ""king
tides"", with or without carbon dioxide emissions.

Sinth
Our two-person household considers climate change an urgent problem. So far, wve have cut our house's carbon
dioxide emissions by nearly 10,000 pounds per year. Here's a quick story about our most recent climate action.
In May 2017, we replaced our old natural gas-fired hot water heater with a heat pump water heater. This
appliance produces hot water by extracting heat from the ambient air surrounding it, employing the same
technology that refrigerators and air conditioners use to perform their work.
The highest-rated conventional storage water heaters and tankless water heaters have at best energy factors of 0.7
for natural gas units and 0.96 for electric resistance ones-meaning that at most 70 and 96 percent of the heat
produced by these heaters actually gets transferred to the water stored inside them. Heat pump water heaters,
however, can achieve energy factors of 2.0 or higher because these devices do not make heat but rather merely
transfer it from the surrounding air to the water inside the tank.
We now have a full year's worth of data and have analyzed the numbers. Replacing our gas water heater with a
heat pump water heater reduced our family's natural gas needs by at least 80 therms. Combusting one therm of
natural gas emits 11 pounds of carbon dioxide. Therefore, our household cut carbon dioxide pollution by at least
880 pounds per year with just this one climate action.
To power the new heat pump water heater, our electricity use increased by nine percent over the course of the
first year of operation. But since we pay on average seven cents extra per day to get the equivalent of 100 percent
of our power from Xcel Energy's Windsource, we achieved this big carbon reduction without adding any new
carbon pollution.
An additional bonus we have enjoyed is a dehumidified basement. Heat pump water heaters dehumidify as they
extract heat energy from the surrounding air. You may be able to reduce or even eliminate your use of a
basement dehumidifier.
Heat pump water heaters won't be right for every home. Since it works by extracting heat energy from the air
surrounding the device, it makes our basement cooler, drier and thus more comfortable in the summer. But it
also makes the basement colder in the winter. We use our basement only for laundry and storage, so a colder
basement in the winter causes us no discomfort. But a heat pump water heater may not be right for you if you
have a basement recreation room.
Fighting global warming will require that we find effective, affordable ways to use renewable energy to replace
natural gas and other fossil fuels to heat our water and heat and cool our homes and businesses. We encourage
you to consider a heat pump water heater when you next need to replace your existing unit.

Stabilization wedges: solving the
climate problem for the next 50
years with current technologies
Stephen Pacala, Robert Socolow
science 305 (5686), 968-972, 2004
Humanity already possesses the fundamental
scientific, technical, and industrial know-how
to solve the carbon and climate problem for
the next half-century. A portfolio of
technologies now exists to meet the world9s
energy needs over the next 50 years and limit
atmospheric CO2 to a trajectory that avoids a
doubling of the preindustrial concentration.
Every element in this portfolio has passed
beyond the laboratory bench and
demonstration project; many are already
implemented somewhere at full industrial
scale. Although no element is a credible
candidate for doing the entire job (or even half
the job) by itself, the portfolio as a whole is
large enough that not every element has to be
used.

We
humans have become just too powerful to suffer a global
famine without causing a mass extinction event.
It will be a famine where most of humanity still
dies in a quest for food and survival. It will be a famine
without hiding places, because hunger will cause people
to betray all secrets & ties in an age of shortwave radio. A
famine where machine-enabled men full of hunger, rage,
and blame make it their main thing in life to find every
bunker & cave. ""Open-up, or we will bust your bunker.""
Thus preparation, global cooperation, and a much
more trustworthy and universal form of democracy seem
the only sensible path forward through the end of days.
The current state of corrupt democracy will result in
nothing but a global catastrophe for everyone on Earth.
People are so keen to insure their cars, homes,
health, national defense and even travel arrangements.
What about our all-important need to eat? Isn't food
insurance more fundamental? The path we are blindly
following today leads to nothing but suffering for everyone
35) If the next ice age really is coming, we are fools not to
store-up many years (or decades) of food supplies while
the sun actually shines. Besides, today's 3-month
worldwide food buffer is still inadequate for another
Tambora-sized eruption, even if no ice age is coming.
and death for most of the world.
Grain is just so cheap. A 1-year supply is only
$140 per person. That's only +$1-trillion for the world, or
about 1.2% of world GDP. And we can still give the grain
to the poor before it expires, or feed livestock with it, or
make alcohol with it. So the net annual cost of say an 8-
year food buffer is only on net, maybe 0.4% of world GDP
annually.
If the grain is kept near freezing and in dry
oxygen-free containers, it will supposedly remain edible
for some 40 years. Thus we are capable of preparing for a
40-year total loss of agricultural output. Thus, we are able
to let everyone die of old age while we reduce our new
generations to whatever size we must reduce them to.
36) Now because I fear the selfishness and stupidity of
some people, I must point something out. It is that 7-billion
people will dig irrigation works for Earth's volcanos 10
times faster than 700-million. However, with regard to a
worldwide ice age famine, it makes little difference
So for those of you with an ear for the Devil's
music: Thanos was not right. Or rather, this horrible idea is
completely unnecessary if we just take some precautions
that are in fact, 10-to-100 times less costly than reducing
our CO2 output.
If we don't substantially increase our food buffer,
whether we are 7-billion or 700-million. We will still have a
humanity WILL eventually experience a huge murderous
famine of all famines at the dawn of the next ice age: A
famine where machine-enabled men comb the planet's
ecosystems looking for food, eating-up many of the
horrible murderous famine and eco-system catastrophe at
the dawn of the next ice age if we only have 3-months
food supply. Thus the primary problem is not to reduce
populations, but to have lots of food stored as a buffer.

How much do direct livestock emissions actually contribute to
global warming?

Abstract
Agriculture directly contributes about 10%-12% of current global anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from livestock. However, such percentage estimates
are based on global warming potentials (GWPS), which do not measure the actual
warming caused by emissions and ignore the fact that methane does not accumulate in
the atmosphere in the same way as CO2. Here, we employ a simple carbon cycle-climate
model, historical estimates and future projections of livestock emissions to infer the
fraction of actual warming that is attributable to direct livestock non-CO2 emissions now
and in future, and to CO, from pasture conversions, without relying on GWPS. We find
that direct livestock non-CO2 emissions caused about 19% of the total modelled warming
of 0.81°C from all anthropogenic sources in 2010. Co, from pasture conversions
contributed at least another 0.03°C, bringing the warming directly attributable to
livestock to 23% of the total warming in 2010. The significance of direct livestock

Scientists at the University of Exeter say a dolphin who learned a complex trick in captivity has taught it to nine of her
friends and family since she was released into the wild. Pictured left is the dolphin, named Billie, who learnt to 'tailwalk'
while recovering from pollution poisoning in a dolphinarium in Adelaide. Billie marks the only known example of a
mammal teaching human tricks to its peers in the wild without any help from a human trainer. The skill allows dolphins
to adapt new behaviours faster than they would through natural selection, potentially giving them the edge over rapid

The plastic industry creates billions and
billions of tonnes of carbon pollution
every year, which is the key cause of
climate change. For starters, most plastic
is made from oil or gas which are fossil
fuels that in turn use other fossil fuels to
be extracted from the ground. Then
there's the transportation, manufacturing
and disposal of the plastic to account
for.
Take 'disposable' plastic water bottles
for example. The carbon footprint of one
of these boffles is 82.8 grams of carbon.

The premise of President Obama's Climate Action Plan is that there is an overwhelming judgment of
science that anthropogenic global warming is already producing devastating impacts, which is
summarized by this statement from the President's Second Inaugural Address:
Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the
devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.
This premise is not strongly supported by scientific evidence:
• the science of climate change is not settled, and evidence reported by the IPCC AR5 weakens
the case for human factors dominating climate change in the 20th and early 21*“ centuries
with the 15+ year hiatus in global warming, there is growing appreciation for the importance of
natural climate variability
the IPCC AR5 and SREX find little evidence that supports an increase in most extreme weather
events that can be attributed to humans, and weather extremes in the U.S. were generally worse
in the 1930's and 1950's than in recent decades.

Mtco2
CLIMATE POLLUTION- All values in MtCO2 per year for 2030. Trudeau's Paris Accord promise was that Canada would cut
emissions to 523 MECO2 by 2030. That is 209 MECO2 below 2014 levels. The green and red bars are emissions released
inside Canada. The black is what Canada digs up and sells to others. The International Energy Agency says that a path to
the 2C global warming limit agreed to in Paris Accord requires oil production to start falling now. Black bars show Canada's
is planning big increases instead. Chart by Barry Saxifrage at VisualCarbon.org and NationalObserver.com. Nov 2016.

that men can't be loving and

Way, a centrist think tank, crunched some numbers for me to put that figure into context.
Here's how to think of the carbon dioxide emissions avoided by Teslas versus clean sources of
electricity:
• A nuclear reactor replacing coal = 541,353 Teslas.
• A nuclear reactor replacing natural gas = 294,041 Teslas.
• Natural gas replacing one coal plant = 98,940 Teslas.
• 100-megawatt wind farm replacing natural gas = 8,267 Teslas.
• Five-megawatt solar farm replacing natural gas = 320 Teslas.
It takes a lot of Teslas to equal the emissions savings of a carbon-free nuclear reactor, and to a lesser
extent other clean energy sources.

To clarify my position on government regulations: I am not generally in favor
of regulations. The fewer, the better. But there are exceptions.
For example, I believe we can all agree that it would be outright crazy to
allow anyone to handle certain aerosol-transmissible pathogens. In this
case, we demand strict regulations. This is because we know that if
something goes wrong, it might affect a lot of people, including us.
Now I believe that certain algorithms, such as Google's search algorithm,
which affect billions of people, are also one of those exceptions. We need to
make sure that these algorithms are not abused for large scale public
opinion manipulations. We need to enforce the transparency, verifiability,
accountability and security of these algorithms.
The temporary deletion of Trump's Twitter account should have been a
wake-up call. Even if we were to trust these companies not to manipulate us
in their own interest, or the interest of a government, one rogue employ with
sufficient access could at the right time wield unprecedented power.
Imagine a similar situation as the Cuban Missile Crisis. What could one
foreign agent or mentally unstable employee provoke by posting something
in the name of a head of state or by sending a few billion people a message
about imminent doom?
Right now we are in a situation in which street food is better regulated than
the products of companies that could affect election outcomes, cause mass
panics or even nuclear wars.

There are just three genuinely rural stations in Paraguay that are currently qperating - Puerto Casado, Mariscal and San Juan.
