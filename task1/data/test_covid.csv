write this book to alert the world of our imminent danger. I wrote this book
in 4 days. During that time I learned things I never knew, or even thought
about in my entire life. The knowledge I acquired from my Cosmic sources
shocked me. But the information contained herein is what they wanted me
to relate. I've done my best to present the information in a comprehensive
yet digestible form. Even though many of you will find this very hard to
Tomthunkit's
Theory of thhe
Universe
swallow.
We are at the intersection of critical mass and times up. Because of our
actions, the time we have left
vanishing fast due to the climate crisis
we've created. We have brought impending doom upon us; unless we unite
to take drastic measures, and make an immediate course correction. We
have run out of highway becausẻ our Creators have run out of patience.
This book is not about me. I cannot solve the problems listed in this book.
I did what I was told. It's up to you and your world leaders to do the rest. Time
is of the essence because we have been scheduled for replacement, which
is planned and ready: but we have been given one more chance for survival.
What we do with it, is up to each and every individual.
The Greatest Siery Ever Told
Read this book. This book lays out a compelling case for immediate action.
It debunks both theories of our origin; Creationism and Evolution. It proves
with clear, convincing, and irrefutable evidence that we were created by
Superior Beings. Our Creators are not happy. We will not be allowed to
destroy this planet (our only home and theirs) and their other creations
before they replace us.
This book contains an URGENT message about your future and the future of
our planet. Everyone SHOULD read this. It maybe the most important book
you ever read. Share it.
One World Left. One Race - Human, One mission: SAVE THE PLANET.
If you care about the people you love and your survival, read this book; then
make an informed decision. Or dismiss it at your peril. This is ngt a joke,
fiction, fantasy or written to scare you. This is yeur FINAL WARNING.

5. 新型冠状病毒感染可以被治愈吗?
所有病毒感染都有一定的自限性,目前已经有新
型冠状病毒感染被治愈的案例(截至1月27日24
时,国家卫生健建康委收到30个省(区、市)累计
治愈出院60例))。
从目前收治的病例情况看,多数患者预后良好,
儿童病例症状相对较轻,少数患者病情危重。死
亡病例多见于老年人和有慢性基础疾病者。
感染症状轻微的患者多数在一周后恢复健康。
良好的个人生活习惯,如:勤洗手、良好的心
情、充足的睡眠、多喝水、营养支持等,都能在
早期感染时给予一定的帮助!

Many Answers Are  In My Book: https://t.co/LiX5IFJ1dI 47 https://t.co/uHxycaBqP7","This book is an alarm. The loudest one I could find. I was chosen to.
write this book to alert the world of our imminent danger. I wrote this book
in 4 days. During that time I learned things I never knew, or even thought
about in my entire life. The knowledge I acquired from my Cosmic sources
shocked me. But the information contained herein is what they wanted me
to relate. I've done my best to present the information in a comprehensive
yet digestible form. Even though many of you will find this very hard to
Tomthunkit's
Theory of thhe
Universe
swallow.
We are at the intersection of critical mass and times up. Because of our
actions, the time we have left
vanishing fast due to the climate crisis
we've created. We have brought impending doom upon us; unless we unite
to take drastic measures, and make an immediate course correction. We
have run out of highway becausẻ our Creators have run out of patience.
This book is not about me. I cannot solve the problems listed in this book.
I did what I was told. It's up to you and your world leaders to do the rest. Time
is of the essence because we have been scheduled for replacement, which
is planned and ready: but we have been given one more chance for survival.
What we do with it, is up to each and every individual.
The Greatest Siery Ever Told
Read this book. This book lays out a compelling case for immediate action.
It debunks both theories of our origin; Creationism and Evolution. It proves
with clear, convincing, and irrefutable evidence that we were created by
Superior Beings. Our Creators are not happy. We will not be allowed to
destroy this planet (our only home and theirs) and their other creations
before they replace us.
This book contains an URGENT message about your future and the future of
our planet. Everyone SHOULD read this. It maybe the most important book
you ever read. Share it.
One World Left. One Race - Human, One mission: SAVE THE PLANET.
If you care about the people you love and your survival, read this book; then
make an informed decision. Or dismiss it at your peril. This is ngt a joke,
fiction, fantasy or written to scare you. This is yeur FINAL WARNING.

outbreak should be ""2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease"" (where 'n' is for novel
and 'CoV' is for coronavirus). This name complies with the WHO Best Practices for
Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which were developed through a
consultative process among partner agencies. Endorsement for the interim name
is being sought from WHO's partner agencies, World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The final name of the
disease will be provided by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). WHO
is also proposing '2019-nCoV' as an interim name of the virus. The final decision
on the official name of the virus will be made by the International Committee on

Novel Coronavirus
Frequently Asked Questions
Q) How does the virus spread ?
Ans- The specific modes of transmission of the virus is not clear yet since
it is a novel virus. This virus probably originally emerged from an
animal source but now seems to be spreading from
person-to-person. It's not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads
from person-to-person. It is thought to have happened mainly when
an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and
other respiratory pathogens spread.
Q) What is Gol doing about 2019-nCoV?
Ans- A 24*7 helpline has been setup by the Gol at NCDC, New Delhi to
answer all queries regarding the disease. The Gol is closely
monitoring the situation and has ascertained the level of
preparedness in every State of India. As this is an emerging, rapidly
evolving situation the Gol will continue to provide updated
information as it becomes available.
Q) Is there a vaccine to get protection from 2019 novel Corona Virus ?
Ans- Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against
2019- novel Corona Virus.
